# Employee-Management-System
A simple full-stack CRUD application with Express using React, Tailwind, NodeJS, MongoDB where I used the POSTMAN and MongoDB Compass app to do the operations and check the outcomes. OAuth that means AccessToken and RefreshToken is used for Login part validation.

The website provide the following functionalities and capabilities:

1. Data Table:
a. Display a table listing employee data.
b. The table should include columns such as Name, Age, Position, and Actions
(Add, Edit, and Delete).

2. Dashboard:
a. Create a dashboard showing summary statistics about employees, such as the
total number of employees and the average age.

3. Search:
a. Implement a search bar that allows users to search for employees by name.
b. As the user types in the search bar, the table should update to show only the
relevant results.

4. Details View:
a. When a user clicks on an employee's row in the data table, displays a details
view showing all the information about the employee (including image, name,
age, and position).

5. Image Upload:
a. Allow users to upload profile images for employees.
b. Display the uploaded images in the data table and details view.

6. Filter by Department:
a. Add a dropdown or select input in the UI where users can choose a department.
b. When a department is selected, update the displayed employee list to only show
employees from that department.

7. Filter by Position:
a. Similarly, add a dropdown or select input for filtering by position.
b. When a position is selected, update the displayed employee list to only show
employees with that position.

8. Implement Authentication for the application

● Implement pagination for the data table if there are a large number of employees.
● Add sorting functionality to the table columns.
● Use a charting library to visualize the distribution of employees based on their positions
in the dashboard.
● Dockerize the Services
● Add Unit tests
